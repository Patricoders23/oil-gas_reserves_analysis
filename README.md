# Oil & Gas Reserves Analysis

This repository presents an exploratory and descriptive analysis of **oil and gas reserves** using Python and data science techniques.  
The objective is to analyze reserves distribution, regional patterns, and comparative insights between oil and gas resources.

The project is designed as a **research-oriented data analysis**, suitable for academic, energy sector
